/// Events emitted during agent execution.
///
/// `AgentEvent` represents observable stages in an agent's workflow, allowing you to monitor
/// the agent's reasoning, tool usage, and responses in real-time.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// The agent emits events in this typical sequence:
/// 1. ``thinking(_:)`` - The model's reasoning process (if enabled)
/// 2. ``toolCall(name:arguments:)`` - A tool being invoked
/// 3. ``toolResult(name:content:)`` - The result from the tool
/// 4. Steps 1-3 repeat as needed
/// 5. ``message(_:)`` - The final answer
/// 6. ``done`` - Workflow complete
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// for try await event in agent.run(prompt: "What is Swift?", model: model) {
///     switch event {
///     case .thinking(let text):
///         print("ðŸ’­ \(text)")
///     case .toolCall(let name, _):
///         print("ðŸ”§ Calling \(name)")
///     case .toolResult(let name, let content):
///         print("ðŸ“Š Result from \(name)")
///     case .message(let text):
///         print("ðŸ’¬ \(text)")
///     case .done:
///         print("âœ… Complete")
///     }
/// }
/// ```
